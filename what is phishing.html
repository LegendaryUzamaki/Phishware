      <h1>
Phishing is one of the cybercrimes in which people (companies and individuals) are contacted by email, telephone or text message by attackers who sound like legitimate and genuine individuals or companies but they intend to trap you into sharing sensitive data such as banking and credit card details, passwords, OTP and personally identifiable information etc.
Then, they use this information to access important accounts causing identity theft and financial loss.
